==== INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS ====

Welcome to this Installation Guide.
Depending on your current situation, the setup for the Map Editor may take up to 30 minutes.

1) Download Python
https://www.python.org/downloads/

2) Install Python
Make sure to tick the boxes: 
"add python.exe to PATH" &
"use admin privileges when installing py.exe"
Then click on "Install Now"

3) Install Visual Studio Code (highly recommended)
https://code.visualstudio.com/download

4) Test Python
Open "powershell.exe" in this folder, then in the black/blue box, type:


python test_python.py


and then press Enter

If in the Powershell window you see that:
"Python has been installed succesfully!" 

then you have installed Python correctly. 
This means you're almost ready to use the Map Editor

5) Install Required Libraries
Open "powershell.exe" again, then type:


python -m ensurepip --upgrade


and press Enter.

Now Python will install pip, or it will tell you that: 
"the requirement has already been satisfied". 
Either works and is good.

Then (while still in the powershell window), type:


pip install matplotlib


and press Enter.

Now Python will install a library, which you will need to run the script.

6) Configure the Map Editor
Go to the main folder, and open "MAP_EDITOR_ALPHA_v1.py" with Visual Studio Code (use "open with")

Go to line 36 and find "SETUP I (mandatory)".
Here you must atleast set your MM1 folder path, and the executable or shortcut that you will be using.

7) Generating your Custom City
Open "powershell.exe" in the main directory.

Then type:

python MAP_EDITOR_ALPHA_v1.py


and press Enter.
(alternatively, you can also type: python m [and then press the Tab key], the sentence will then auto complete to "python MAP_EDITOR_ALPHA_v1.py" saving you time)

8) Have fun building your Cities!
