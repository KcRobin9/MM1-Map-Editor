==== INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS ====

Welcome to this Installation Guide.
Depending on your current situation, the setup for the Map Editor may take up to 30 minutes.

1) Download Python
https://www.python.org/downloads/

2) Download Visual Studio Code (strongly recommended)
https://code.visualstudio.com/download

3) Install Python
Double click the downloaded executable
Make sure to tick the boxes: 
"add python.exe to PATH" &
"use admin privileges when installing py.exe"
Then click on "Install Now"

4) Test Python
Double click on "Install_Me.bat"

5) Configure the Map Editor
Install_Me.bat will do various things, but it will also open the main script ("MAP_EDITOR_ALPHA_v1.py") for you.

While in the script, go to line 36 and find "SETUP I (mandatory)".
Here you must (atleast) set your MM1 folder path.

Afterwards, read the (user)notes in the script to familiarize yourself with the editor.
But importantly, you can go to approx. line 750 in the Main Script, and start setting Polygons and Textures there.

6) Creating your Custom City
Double click on "Run_Editor_Script.bat" in the main directory:

Or open "powershell.exe" in the main directory, and type: `python MAP_EDITOR_ALPHA_v1.py` and press Enter

(alternatively, you can also type: python m [and then press the Tab key], the sentence will then auto complete to 
"python MAP_EDITOR_ALPHA_v1.py", saving you time)

7) Have fun building your Cities!
