==== INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS ====

Welcome to this Installation Guide.
Depending on your current situation, the setup for the Map Editor may take up to 30 minutes.

1) Download Python (required)
https://www.python.org/downloads/

2) Download Visual Studio Code (strongly recommended)
https://code.visualstudio.com/download

3) Download Blender (3.6) (strongly recommended)
https://www.blender.org/download/

4) Install Python
Use the default settings provided by the installer

5) Configure Visual Studio Code
Go to the Extensions tab, and search for + install the following:
"Pylance"
"Blender Development" 
"Better Comments" (by Aaron Bond) (not required, but recommended)

6) Test Python and Install Required Libraries
Double click on "Install_Me.bat" and let the script do its thing

7) Connect Python and Blender
Watch this tutorial from 3:48 onwards: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUytEtaVrrc
N.B. some parts are already covered in this tutorial, and not all parts are relevant.
However, it showcases some critical steps to set the right permissions and connect Python to Blender.

If after going through all steps it's not working, send me a message. I'm happy to help out.

8) Build your First City
Open the script and direct the Editor to your Midtown Madness folder, e.g. "mm1_folder = r"C:\Users\robin\Desktop\MM1_game" 

The Editor comes with a test city (i.e. polygons) and has options set in a way such that you can immediately build the city.
To do this, open "powershell".exe in the main directory. Then type:
"python m [press the Tab] key" and press enter.
Pressing the Tab key after you entered "m" will autofill the name into "python MAP_EDITOR_ALPHA_v1.py"
The script will now build the city, and immediately boot you into the game. Click Cruise, pick a car, and start driving.
