This debug EXE can be found in "Midtown Madness Sneak Preview\debug" on the disk. Basically it's same thing as the normal midtown.exe file, but without any dev/debug stuff stripped out. It has a ton of features waiting to be uncovered.

Problem is that it doesn't seem to want to run, at least on modern operating systems. This EXE has been patched to correct the flaw that causes this. It has also been modified to allow for hardware rendering in the main menu, which fixes an additional crash after returning to the menu from a race.

Finally, it has also been modified to unlock further debug options than what is available by default.
